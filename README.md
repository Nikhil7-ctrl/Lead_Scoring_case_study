# Lead_Scoring_case_study
A logistic regression model built for X Education company to increase the lead conversion rate.
## Problem Statement
The company X Education sells online courses to industry professionals.The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google and the people who land on the website might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When these people fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, they are classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X education is around 30%. Now the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’ the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%. To make this process effective let's build logistic regression model, the conversion predictions and evaluation metrics to achieve this.
